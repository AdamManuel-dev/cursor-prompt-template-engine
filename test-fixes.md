# Test Fixes Applied

## Issue Analysis
The config.test.ts failures are due to chalk formatting being included in the logger calls. The mock chalk implementation adds [COLOR] tags, but the tests weren't expecting these.

## Root Cause
- Tests expected plain strings but got chalk-formatted strings
- Mock chalk adds [CYAN], [BOLD], [GREEN], [YELLOW], [RED] tags
- Logger.success, logger.info, logger.warn include emoji and formatting

## Fixes Applied
1. Updated test expectations to include chalk formatting tags
2. Updated success message expectations to include emoji
3. Fixed path expectations to include [GRAY] formatting
4. Fixed key-value display expectations to include [BOLD] formatting
